## Why Lumina Note

- **Local-first by design**: your vault is local, and you decide what to send to model providers.
- **Knowledge-centered workflow**: Markdown editor, WikiLinks, and graph view work together naturally.
- **AI that can actually act**: Chat, Agent, Deep Research, and Codex mode support real editing and retrieval tasks.
